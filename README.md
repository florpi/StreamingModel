Towards a non-Gaussian model of Redshift Space Distortions

## Introduction
The peculiar motion of galaxies on an expanding background make the translation from redshifts to distances non-trivial, due to the additional Doppler effect. When we measure the clustering of galaxies without removing the effect of their motions, we are measuring a combination of their actual clustering and their pairwise velocity distribution [1],
